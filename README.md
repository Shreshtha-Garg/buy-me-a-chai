# Buy Me a Chai

Buy Me a Chai is a crowdfunding platform for developers and creators to get funds from their supporters. Inspired by Patreon and Buy Me a Coffee, this platform aims to provide a simple and effective way for creators to receive financial support for their work.

## Project Overview

This project is built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) along with Tailwind CSS for styling and Razorpay for payment integration. Additionally, it supports user authentication using credentials and GitHub.

## Live Demo

Check out the live demo of the project: [Buy Me a Chai](https://buy-me-a-chai-ten.vercel.app/)

## Getting Started

To get started with the project locally, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed on your machine:

- Node.js
- npm or yarn or pnpm or bun
- MongoDB

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/buy-me-a-chai.git
   cd buy-me-a-chai
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   # or
   yarn install
   # or
   pnpm install
   # or
   bun install
   ```

3. Set up environment variables:

   Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory and add the following variables:
   ```
   MONGODB_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
   NEXTAUTH_URL=http://localhost:3000
   NEXTAUTH_SECRET=your_secret_key
   GITHUB_CLIENT_ID=your_github_client_id
   GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET=your_github_client_secret
   RAZORPAY_KEY_ID=your_razorpay_key_id
   RAZORPAY_KEY_SECRET=your_razorpay_key_secret
   ```

### Running the Development Server

Run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Features
